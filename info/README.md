## Description
Originally released on 8 January 2015, *Sound System I* was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. The images used are by William Turner. The sounds used are a combination of Audacity-generated tones and synth and drum-machine samples.

In June of 2022 I was finally able to convince HaxeFlixel to rebuild the game as a browser-friendly HTML5 version (and Mac and Windows releases too). Nice!
